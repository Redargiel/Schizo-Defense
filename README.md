## Gameplay
Like other tower defense games, enemies will go from point A (their spawn) to point B (your home) and try to destroy it, you will be defending your home by placing turrets down and by killing the agents you get more blood money to build more turrets. You can finish the game by survivng all the waves or get destroyd by the agents (enemies).
## Controlls
When you start the game you will enter the main menu. Press the start button to start the game. Inside the game you can see how much blood money you have in the upper right corner. In the lower middle of the screen you can see the menu holding your towers that you can place. Click the tower you want to place and click on the place to put towers on. Done now you can play the game. Good Luck <3
